# MultiEmo: Multilingual, Multilevel, Multidomain Sentiment Analysis Corpus of Consumer Reviews

MultiEmo: a new benchmark data set for the multilingual sentiment analysis task including 11 languages. The collection contains consumer reviews from four domains: medicine, hotels, products and university. The original reviews in Polish contained 8,216 documents consisting of 57,466 sentences. The reviews were manually annotated with sentiment at the level of the whole document and at the level of a sentence (3 annotators per element). We achieved a high Positive Specific Agreement value of 0.91 for texts and 0.88 for sentences. The collection was then translated automatically into English, Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Russian, German, Spanish, French, Dutch and Portuguese. MultiEmo is publicly available under the MIT Licence. We present the results of the evaluation using the latest cross-lingual deep learning models such as XLM-RoBERTa, MultiFiT and LASER+BiLSTM. We have taken into account 3 aspects in the context of comparing the quality of the models: multilingualism, multilevel and multidomain knowledge transfer ability.
